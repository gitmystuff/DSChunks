group, and aggregate data from a large dataset, making it easier to analyze complex information.\n","\n","### Core Function and Process\n","\n","The primary function of a pivot table is to take individual items from an extensive table (like a spreadsheet or database) and group them into a compact, easily readable matrix based on discrete categories.\n","\n","The process involves four key actions:\n","\n","1.  **Pivoting:** Selecting a field from the original data and using its unique values to form the **rows** and **columns** of the new summary table.\n","2.  **Grouping:** Categorizing the data based on the chosen row and column fields.\n","3.  **Aggregation:** Applying an aggregation function (such as **sum**, **average**, **count**, $\\text{min}$, or $\\text{max}$) to the data field that resides in the table's central **values** area.\n","4.  **Summarization:** Displaying the calculated statistics for each intersection of the row and column categories.\n","\n","### Key Advantage\n","\n","The main advantage of a pivot table is its **flexibility** and **speed**. A user can quickly \"pivot\" the data—changing which fields are used for rows, columns, and values—to analyze the same data from multiple perspectives without altering the original source data.\n","\n","\n","\n","Contingency table.
