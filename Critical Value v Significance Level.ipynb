Key Definitions\n","\n","| Term | Definition | Role |\n","| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n","| **Level of Significance** ($\\alpha$) | The probability of **rejecting the null hypothesis ($H_0$) when it is actually true** (committing a **Type I error**). This probability is chosen by the researcher. | Determines the size of the **rejection region** in the sampling distribution. |\n","| **Critical Value** | A value of the test statistic that **separates the rejection region from the acceptance region** in a hypothesis test. | The **threshold** the calculated test statistic must meet or exceed to reject $H_0$. |\n","\n","### 2. The Necessary Correction\n","\n","The second paragraph states: \"The level of significance is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the test statistic exceeds the critical value.\"\n","\n","* **Correction:** This statement is redundant and slightly misleading. By definition, the **rejection region** *is* the area where the test statistic exceeds the critical value. The **level of significance ($\\alpha$)** is the *area (probability)* of that rejection region **under the null hypothesis distribution**.\n","\n","### 3. The Relationship Illustrated\n","\n","The Critical Value and the Level of Significance ($\\alpha$) are interdependent:\n","\n","* **Determining the Critical Value:** The critical value is determined by the **type of test** (e.g., $t$-test, $z$-test) and the **level of significance** ($\\alpha$) chosen by the researcher.\n","* **Example (One-Tailed $z$-test, $\\alpha = 0.05$):** The critical $z$-value is the point that cuts off the top $5\\%$ (or bottom $5\\%$) of the $z$-distribution. If the calculated **test statistic** falls into that $5\\%$ tail (the rejection region, i.e., it **exceeds the critical value**), the researcher rejects the null hypothesis.\n","\n","## Importance of the Level of Significance ($\\alpha$)\n","\n","The choice of $\\alpha$ is a crucial decision for the researcher because it defines the risk profile of the test:\n","\n","### 1. Type I Error Risk\n","\n","The level of significance directly determines the risk of making a **Type I error** (rejecting $H_0$ when it is true). If $\\alpha = 0.05$, the researcher accepts a $5\\%$ chance of mistakenly concluding that a treatment works when it actually doesn't.\n","\n","### 2. Power Tradeoff\n","\n","The level of significance is also related to the **power of the test** (the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when it is false).\n","\n","* **Higher $\\alpha$ (e.g., $0.10$):** **Increases the power** (easier to find an effect) but also **increases the risk of making a Type I error**.\n","* **Lower $\\alpha$ (e.g., $0.01$):** **Decreases the power** (harder to find an effect) but also **decreases the risk of making a Type I error**.\n","\n","The researcher must select an $\\alpha$ value that appropriately balances the risk of a false positive ($\\alpha$) against the risk of a false negative (missing a real effect)."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.7"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
