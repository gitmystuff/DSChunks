For 9 we can write those ways as (621), (531), (522), (441), (432), and (333).

Once we’ve made this decomposition, we can see that the outcomes are equally probable and we can apply the law.

The servant pulled open the lining to find hidden within it folded sheets of parchment and paper. Pascal had apparently carried them with him every day for the last eight years of his life. Scribbled on the sheets, in his handwriting, was a series of isolated words and phrases dated November 23, 1654. The writings were an emotional account of the trance, in which he described how God had come to him and in the space of two hours delivered him from his corrupt ways. Following that revelation, Pascal had dropped most of his friends, calling them “horrible attachments.”\n","    * He sold his carriage, his horses, his furniture, his library—everything except his Bible. He gave his money to the poor, leaving himself with so little that he often had to beg or borrow to obtain food. He wore an iron belt with points on the inside so that he was in constant discomfort and pushed the belt’s spikes into his flesh whenever he found himself in danger of feeling happy. He denounced his studies of mathematics and science. Of his childhood fascination with geometry, he wrote, “I can scarcely remember that there is such a thing as geometry. I recognize geometry to be so useless…it is quite possible I shall never think of it again.”\n","    * Yet Pascal remained productive. In the years that followed the trance, he recorded his thoughts about God, religion, and life. Those thoughts were later published in a book titled Pensées, a work that is still in print today. And although Pascal had denounced mathematics, amid his vision of the futility of the worldly life is a mathematical exposition in which he trained his weapon of mathematical probability squarely on a question of theology and created a contribution just as important as his earlier work on the problem of points."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"fc564c75","metadata":{"id":"fc564c75"},"source":["### Factorials\n","\n","$n!$<br />\n","5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3d027033","metadata":{"id":"3d027033"},"source":["### Permutations\n","\n","Order does matter (permutation, position)<br />\n","The combination of a safe\n","\n","$_{n}P_r = \\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$\n","\n","with repetitions\n","\n","$n^r$"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b91a13d7","metadata":{"id":"b91a13d7"},"source":["### Combinations\n","\n","Order doesn't matter<br />\n","Items on a pizza\n","\n","$C(n,r) = C_r^{n} = {_nC_r} = \\binom {n}{r}  = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$\n","\n","#### With Replacement\n","\n","$_{n+r-1}C_r = \\frac{(r+n-1)!}{r!(n-1)!}$"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2972acd9","metadata":{"id":"2972acd9"},"source":["### Intersections\n","\n","$A \\cap B = \\{\\: x: x \\in A \\: and \\: x \\in B \\:\\}$\n","\n","order doesn't matter $A \\cap B$ or $B \\cap A$\n","\n","#### Independent\n","\n","$P(A \\cap B) = P(A) * P(B)$\n","\n","#### Dependent\n","\n","$P(A \\cap B) = P(A) * P(B|A) = P(B) * P(A|B)$<br />\n","also expressed as P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B given A)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"cf00b353","metadata":{"id":"cf00b353"},"source":["### Unions\n","\n","$P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)$<br />\n","also expressed P(A or B)<br />\n","order doesn't matter\n","\n","#### Unions if mutually exclusive (vs. disjoint)\n","\n","$P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)$ where $P(A \\cap B) = 0$\n","<br />so<br />\n","$P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$\n","\n","Mutually Exclusive: $P(A \\cap B) = 0$<br />\n","Disjoint (dealing in sets): $A \\cap B = 0$"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ce98a03b","metadata":{"id":"ce98a03b"},"source":["### Complement\n","\n","Complement of $A$ is $\\bar{A}$\n","\n","Is the complement of A mutually exclusive with A?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"18aaae35","metadata":{"id":"18aaae35"},"source":["## Conditional Probability\n","\n","https://towardsdatascience.com/conditional-probability-with-a-python-example-fd6f5937cd2<br />\n","https://towardsdatascience.com/conditional-probability-with-python-concepts-tables-code-c23ffe65d110<br />\n","\n","$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$<br />\n","\n","What's the probability of something given something else\n","\n","Terms\n","* $P(A|B)$: Probability of A given B\n","* $P(A \\cap B)$: Probability of A and B\n","* $P(B)$: Probability of B\n","\n","#### Addition and Multiplication Rules\n","\n","* Addition Rule: $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)$\n","* Multiplication Rule: $P(A \\cap B) = P(A) * P(B|A)$<br />"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8647d10f","metadata":{"id":"8647d10f"},"source":["## Adding or Multiplying Probabilities\n","\n","* If using the word `or`, add\n","* If using the word `and`, multiply\n","    * What's the probability of rolling a 1 or a 6\n","    * What's the probability of first rolling a 1 and then a 6\n","    \n","### Probability of Two Events Occurring Together: Independent\n","\n","$P(A \\cap B) = P(A) * P(B)$\n","\n","Multiply the probabilities of each event together\n","\n","Example problem: The probability of getting a job you applied for is 45% and the probability of you getting the apartment you applied for is 75%.
