Language models generate probabilities by **training on text corpora in one or many languages**. Given that languages can be used to express an infinite variety of valid sentences (the property of digital infinity), language modeling faces the problem of assigning non-zero probabilities to linguistically valid sequences that may never be encountered in the training data... Language models are useful for a variety of problems in computational linguistics; from initial **applications in speech recognition** to ensure nonsensical (i.e. low-probability) word sequences are not predicted, to wider use in **machine translation** (e.g. scoring candidate translations), **natural language generation (generating more human-like text)**, **part-of-speech tagging, parsing, optical character recognition, handwriting recognition, grammar induction, information retrieval, etc**. Since 2018, **large language models (LLMs) consisting of deep neural networks with billions of trainable parameters, trained on massive datasets of unlabelled text**, have demonstrated impressive results on a wide variety of natural language processing tasks. This development has led to a shift in research focus toward the use of general-purpose LLMs.\n","\n","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Word Embeddings\n","\n","* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viZrOnJclY0\n","* https://aneesha.medium.com/using-tsne-to-plot-a-subset-of-similar-words-from-word2vec-bb8eeaea6229\n","* In natural language processing, a word embedding is a representation of a word.

Cosine similarity is the cosine of the angle between the vectors; that is, it is the dot product of the vectors divided by the product of their lengths. It follows that the cosine similarity does not depend on the magnitudes of the vectors, but only on their angle. The cosine similarity always belongs to the interval -1, 1. For example, two proportional vectors have a cosine similarity of 1, two orthogonal vectors have a similarity of 0, and two opposite vectors have a similarity of -1. For example, in information retrieval and text mining, each word is assigned a different coordinate and a document is represented by the vector of the numbers of occurrences of each word in the document. Cosine similarity then gives a useful measure of how similar two documents are likely to be, in terms of their subject matter, and independently of the length of the documents. The technique is also used to measure cohesion within clusters in the field of data mining.\n","\n","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"mm40n8IyvIBP","outputId":"b0c500f9-b4eb-4c7d-fcd3-d92890dfedb7"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style

The same can be said in the relationship between topics and documents. We can use topics and the words in topics for knowledge discovery without going through the entire document. These latent topics are like clustering, which we’ll cover a little more next week, and since they’re latent, we really don’t know, at first, what the big theme of the topic is so we just say that this group of words belong to topic 1, this group of words to topic 2, and so on. At some point, we might be able to give a topic a name, but it’s not necessary for our purposes.
