This assumption is often called the **Principle of the Uniformity of Nature**.\n","\n","#### Why Deduction Fails\n","\n","Hume pointed out that the opposite of the inductive claim—\"The sun will **not** rise tomorrow\"—is perfectly conceivable and **does not imply a logical contradiction**. Because the denial of the claim is possible, the claim itself cannot be proven by deductive reasoning.\n","\n","#### Why Induction Fails\n","\n","If we try to justify the belief that the future will resemble the past by appealing to experience, the argument becomes circular:\n","\n","* **Premise:** The future will resemble the past because it has **always** done so in the past.\n","* **The Circularity:** This argument assumes the very principle it is trying to prove: that what happened in the past (the uniformity of nature) will continue to happen in the future.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Hume's Conclusion\n","\n","Hume concluded that our expectation that the sun will rise isn't a rational, reasoned certainty. Instead, it is a matter of **custom** and **habit**. Because we have constantly observed a sequence of events (sunrise following dawn), our mind is simply conditioned to anticipate that conjunction in the future.

Even if this prior is very small (but not zero), it gives the hypothesis a starting chance.\n","* **Sequential Updating:** Every time the sun rises, that event serves as new **Data** that is fed back into Bayes' Theorem.\n","* **Coherent Learning:** The theorem dictates that a long string of consistent observations (like the sun rising millions of times) will cause the posterior probability of the hypothesis (the sun-rising mechanism is stable) to converge toward one.\n","\n","Therefore, the belief that the sun will rise is justified not by a deductive proof of necessity, but by a mathematically sound and rigorous **rule for updating probability** based on accumulating evidence.
